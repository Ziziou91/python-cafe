"""A simple application to practice working with dictonaties and lists.

The app simulates a cafe and the user can interact with it as either:
- The owner: view current stock level and total value, as well as production cost and value of each dish 
- A patron: order items from the menu (unless they've run out), tell the staff your finished and get your bill
